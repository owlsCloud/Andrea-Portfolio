          April 14th, 2019. We competed at the WGI World Championships for the
          first time ever this weekend, as a first year group, from a small
          region called THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY.
          <br />
          <br /> UTRGV Winds, the group that set the standard. The Rio Grande
          Valley is a place we all call home. A place where we find ourselves
          proud of our culture and where we show nothing but hard work and
          dedication. Slowly growing and showing the world what we are capable
          of.
          <br />
          <br /> When we first became an organization our goal for this year was
          to receive a medal in open class. Well folks, we exceeded that goal by
          getting bumped up to world-class, competing among the toughest groups
          in the world, and receiving 3rd place! We are beyond proud of everyone
          and we can not thank you enough for your support.
          <br />
          <br /> We have had the blessed opportunity to have such motivated and
          driven students and staff to make this happen. Dr. Saul Torres, Mr.
          Dempsey, Ben Lee, Edgar Ortiz, Ediel Ovalle, Tirzah Claus, and so many
          more people on board were the foundation of what this group needed to
          be pushed forward. Along with the help of our local high schools
          McAllen HS, and PSJA Southwest High School, a big thank you for coming
          together and lending us equipment to use to for the season.
          <br />
          <br /> ​ Until next season. Stay on the lookout for audition
          information

          the SECOND time ever this weekend.
          <br />
          <br />
          ​ After a 26-hour bus ride, the group heads straight to sleep and is
          up bright and early to rehearse for prelims. Spending over a day on
          the bus, the group is tired but ready to do what they have to do. Up
          and early at 5 am. With a long day ahead of them the energy, the group
          is showing is unconditional. The love and support being sent from back
          home is overwhelming and has the members enthralled and ready to
          compete. <br />

          ​ The group heads back to the hotel and gets ready to rest up for the
          final day. <br />
          <br />
          Last-minute preparations, paintings, students washing their uniforms
          and getting everything ready for the big day. Members are sharing
          moments from the season as they stare at the night sky. Moments they
          loved, moments they loved not as much, and moments they have been
          wanting to share. No matter the results, the group knew they made it.
          The past three years were overwhelming and never knew what was to
          come. After having their second season cut short due to COVID-19, They
          were there. <br />
